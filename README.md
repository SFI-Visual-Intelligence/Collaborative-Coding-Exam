## Project Description
This project involves collaborative work on a digit classification task, where each participant works on distinct but interconnected components within a shared codebase. <br>
The main goal is to develop and train digit classification models collaboratively, with a focus on leveraging shared resources and learning efficient experimentation practices.
### Key Aspects of the Project:
- **Individual and Joint Tasks:** Each participant has separate tasks, such as implementing a digit classification dataset, a neural network model, and an evaluation metric. However, all models and datasets must be compatible, as we can only train and evaluate using partners' models and datasets.
- **Shared Environment:** Alongside working on our individual tasks, we collaborate on joint tasks like the main file, and training and evaluation loops. Additionally, we utilize a shared Weights and Biases environment for experiment management.
- **Documentation and Package Management:** To ensure proper documentation and ease of use, we set up Sphinx documentation and made the repository pip-installable
- **High-Performance Computing:** A key learning objective of this project is to gain experience with running experiments on high-performance computing (HPC) resources. To this end, we trained all models on a cluster

## Installation

Install from:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/SFI-Visual-Intelligence/Collaborative-Coding-Exam.git
```

or using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv add git+https://github.com/SFI-Visual-Intelligence/Collaborative-Coding-Exam.git
```

To verify:

```sh
python -c "import CollaborativeCoding"
```

## Usage

TODO: Fill in

### Running on a k8s cluster

In your job manifest, include:

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: some-container-name
          image: "ghcr.io/sfi-visual-intelligence/collaborative-coding-exam:main"
          # ...
```

to pull the latest build, or check the [packages](https://github.com/SFI-Visual-Intelligence/Collaborative-Coding-Exam/pkgs/container/collaborative-coding-exam), for earlier versions.

> [!NOTE]
> The container is build for a `linux/amd64` architecture to properly build Cuda 12. For other architectures please build the docker image locally.
