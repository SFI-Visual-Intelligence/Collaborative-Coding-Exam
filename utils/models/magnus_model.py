        Initializes the MagnusModel, a neural network designed for image classification tasks.

        The model consists of three linear layers, each with 133 neurons, and uses ReLU activation
        functions between the layers. The first layer's input size is determined by the image shape
        and number of channels, while the output layer's size is determined by the number of classes.

            num_classes (int): The number of output classes for classification.
            nr_channels (int): The number of channels in the input image.
